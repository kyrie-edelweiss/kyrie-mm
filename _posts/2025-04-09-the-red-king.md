## Period: 15 Years Ago … Year: 1969 … Location: VENUS

***BDYRECK-FOOTAGE – VAP 06-011 – 03-01-1969***
***AUDIO… ACTIVE***

*The buzz & hum of the device drowns out the almost faint sobbing cries of several men.*
YOUNG WOMAN: "Fuck, fuck fuck fuck! I'm close, I'm close!"
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: "Hold his head like that! Fuck it dry!"

***VIDEO… ACTIVE***

*The video feed produces grainy images of a hotel reception interior. The windows are boarded up, and small rays of hazy yellow shine through them. In the frame, six women of varying ages are gathered around three men tied to chairs with rags. The women are performing various degrading sexual acts on the male victims.*

***MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION***

YOUNG WOMAN: F-fuck, fuck, this is just about the sixth time… I need more, I NEED MORE!

*Just barely, an older woman can be seen in the back, commanding the younger ones.*

OLDER WOMAN: Abigail, rip his cock clean off! Do it with your teeth!
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: They deserve it, the cocksuckers!

*The camera falls to the right side – the symbol of **VENUS** is scrawled on the entrance door.*

OLDER WOMAN: Now slit his fucking throat! Slide your shank across it and drink the blood, put it inside of you, do whatever you want!
OLDER WOMAN: Shove his cock up his ass, it's yours to take! Rip his ass apart!

*This continues for an entire two hours. Eventually, every man slowly dies from their inflicted wounds and exhaustion.*

YOUNG WOMAN: Oh, look! This VAP fucker had a reckorder on him – wasn't this one your daddy, Sarah?

*This Sarah and the young woman share some passing remarks as they giggle.*

*As the girls continue to gossip, a red-haired woman climbs down the stairs from the second floor. She nods at the older woman.*

OLDER WOMAN: So you're sure, absolutely sure that this'll work?
REDHEAD: I'm sure. Something beautiful is going to happen. Those 7-P bastards are gonna kneel in less than a century.

## ACT 2 – The Table Is Set
## Period: 8 Years Ago … Year: 1976 … Location: NEPTUNE

*A dozen people sit in their chairs next to a massive table in a lavishly-decorated and open room. At the end sits an imposing figure with their hands cupped. The figure starts speaking…*

"I'm gonna call everyone's name out while my assistant matches faces to names. Our first meeting has officially begun. Raise your hand when you're called out. Listen up", says the imposing figure.

"Anderson. Ayden. Bernstein. Cat. D'Agostino. Green – You the art specialist? No? Okay… Jones. Kildare. Lamont. Michael. Suarez. Weiss - Oh, you're the art specialist. Zimmer."

"That's everyone? Alright. Good morning. I'm Avery-Mary Edelweiss. I command the entirety of this department. This is William Hertz, my personal assistant. Welcome to the Seven Planet Committee", she says with a half-grin on her wrinkled face.

"First of all: congratulations. We know how much work you put in to get this far, and we know that you've all left behind promising careers in engineering, R&D, finance, defense and so on. Just bear in mind that we know what you've done to get here. This might be the last time you hear these words for a while, so listen real closely: Well done", the woman's voice booms.

*Cat & Suarez share a half-giggle as Anderson, Ayden, Kildare and Weiss clap.*

"Let's get to the point", she continues.

"Thanks to those extremists who've hijacked the Edelweiss Station, the ones who took control of our beloved **VENUS**, and countless other atrocities committed in the name of radical sex supremacy, we've founded this department to crack down on this growing female-led terrorism…", Edelweiss states as a matter-of-fact.

*Green whistles. Then, the room erupts into clapping.*

"These fuckers won't have it easy from this point forward. We'll make their lives a living hell, and we'll destroy what remains of their little revolution. We start from the outer reaches – **NEPTUNE** – and we will uproot these weeds from across all of our planetary provinces", she gestures.

*Hollering, whistling and clapping are heard from all across.*

"I'll let my assistant – William – take it from here. He's a very capable, passionate & smart man."

"**MERCURY:** When they decimated the air filtration plants, they wiped themselves out in the process. So there's nothing left to do there. Cheers to their suicidal urges, and a toast to our growing effort. We will rebuild on their ashes", he says, inviting them to celebrate.

*Everyone involved has a moment of shared laughter.*

"In all seriousity, a moment of silence for all the innocents we've lost on **MERCURY**…", Edelweiss demands.

*The room is still.*

"**VENUS**: The situation is dire."

*A gasp is heard.*

"As the home planet of their inconsequential revolution, this is where they concentrated all their efforts. Our telecommunication grid is offline since 1966, there's no sync installations left, and our local Asset Protection force was pulled back in 1969. We can hence consider every person on **VENUS** a living security threat, and remove them by any means necessary. But in all seriousness, we may never finish the work we started in 1962.", the man says in a grave tone.

"We'll discuss **VENUS** later."

"Earth: What is there to say about Earth? It's dead. We don't recognize it.", William says half-jokingly.

*Green almost musters a sentence, but quickly hesitates.*

"**MARS:** **MARS** was always… odd. Despite being our first colonization candidate, any and all efforts to get ourselves established there have ended in mysterious ways. So we've just never set foot on it ever since, and likely, that's the way it'll always be. The revolution seems to be almost contained by this hunk of red soil… Moving on."

*Cat & Suarez share some remarks between themselves. Jones & Michael follow accordingly.*

"**JUPITER:** Our tiny R&D moons – Io, Europa & Ganymede are fine, they've never had any sex supremacist sentiments and we intend to keep it this way. We'll increase our foothold there by diverting more money. Callisto has had some history now and then, but we're sure it'll be fine."

*Anderson, Green and Zimmer share a glance.*

"**SATURN:** Ever since we've left Earth, we knew - this would be the site of our religious expansion. The people on living **SATURN**'s ring – the 200,000 centers of faith built atop the shattered moons – are zealots by nature and tightly guard their beliefs & ideas atop their gated communities. We don't have to intervene here, and they'd like to keep our intervention minimal anyway."

*Lamont nods approvingly.*

"**URANUS:** We train most of our military & defense contractors here, on the Pillar – a vertical training center & arms factory megastructure that pierces the core of the planet. We've implemented strict directives to execute anyone suspected of Venusian ideals, and as long as we keep these directives under control, we shouldn't have to work on **URANUS** that much."

*Kildare is not surprised.*

"**NEPTUNE:** The seat of management – its bureaucracy represented by the unending tunnels and urban centers built on top of the now-hidden ice. And far, far above, we have the Synchronity Complex. This is the first foothold we establish – if **NEPTUNE** falls, we all fall.", William concludes.

*A thunderous applause echoes in the meeting room.*

## ACT 3 – Katherina

## Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus

There were many dwellers within the expanse of space – some with names, others nameless – that witnessed humanity when they departed from Earth to the outer reaches of space…

And then there once was a young woman – Katherina.
The nights were cold out here, the sky was blacker than black.
She'd subsist on her canned food reserve, read old books by the phosphorus-light, and every now and then enjoy her signature mixed tea alongside a little syrup…

And whenenever she mustered the energy, she'd leave her little phosphorus-illuminated abode and try to find others – her search would continue for years & years.
But sometimes, Katherina would dream of her father and mother.
And she would only spiral further and further…

Kneeling, she pleads to the celestial bodies – the empty sky greeting her with silence – as she thinks…

*"I hope someone visits me soon*
*That's what I need*
*I won't be alone anymore*
*When they come visit me*
*I won't be so cold anymore*
*It'll be nice to not be alone*
*I can't be alone anymore*
*I hope someone visits me soon*
*I won't be alone anymore"* 

Time would march on, the emptiness and loneliness in her chest expanding, as she always hoped that, after all, if there was still someone, they'd reach out…

For all she ever knew, there was no one and nothing left.
Katherina, stranded in a vast frigid place, ever since the **SUN** departed…

## ACT 4 – The RED KING
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus

Katherina was laid upon her bed, half-dreaming, after voraciously consuming the latest find that she'd tossed in the Venusian literature pile…

'Til in the corner of her half-lcuid eye, a massive shadow creeped on her thigh… then to her chest… then this shadow would envelop her.

The crackle of thunder in the sky would stop, and the thick fume of air would stand still, and behind her half-sleeping body, beyond the corner of her window, would stand still the gaze of **MARS** himself.

Shudders of fear would grip her mind, as her eyes met the red planet, which got closer and closer to her, and her dreams would run away, and she'd start to awake, and she'd reach for the knife in the bedside table…

A voice echoes across the room – no, across Venus itself:
**"LITTLE GIRL."**
Katherina screamed like a banshee. The sound pierced her, it was overwhelming her, it was so, so, so loud... the bedframe would rattle…

The same voice continues:
**"YOU RUN TOO FAR IN THE DARK AND YOU GET YOURSELF LOST."**
She takes a good look – she's not in any dream no more, this is as real as it gets. Her pleading was finally answered, but not by whom she expected to answer. This was **MARS**, the full **MARS**, the fourth planet from the **SUN**.

Then the **RED KING** would reassure her, more quiet this time:
**"CALM DOWN. I AM WHOLE. I CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE."**
She opens her mouth…

She starts telling him how alone she'd been, and how there's no one left, and how she'd searched everywhere, and how she stockpiled her rations into boxes upon boxes of the stuff, and how she doesn't even know if she has a mother or a father, and that she can't remember her childhood, and finally she tells him that her name is Katherina.

This noise would no longer rattle her entire home. And it'd start to no longer rattle her soul:
**"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME, LITTLE GIRL."**

## ACT 5 – His Queen

## Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus

Katherina & **MARS** would have several discussions about her life over that feverish dream of an hour. She'd sit on the edge of her bed facing the window & he, despite the lack of face, would seem more and more interested.

. . .

During the heated discussion, Katherina lets out a sly remark about her desires, and what she knew of the men that roamed Venus. **MARS** is quick to notice this, and interjects:  
**"I'M THE PERFECT MAN. I AM THE CONCEPT OF MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE ME."**  
She's interested. They talk about this for a while.

. . .

Eventually, she asks what happened to the other humans, and what happened to the stars in the night-sky. **MARS** proclaims:  
**"THE OTHERS ARE GONE. THEY ABANDONED US."**  
Katherina is shocked – it seems that he doesn't know precisely what happened either, just that they're gone. **MARS** then adds:  
**"IT'S JUST US NOW. IT'S JUST US NOW."**  
The girl agrees. They continue to discuss this for a solid ten minutes, until **MARS** sets the facts straight:  
**"THEY RAVAGED IT. ALL OF IT. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT."**  
She now knows that the Venusian humans destroyed eachother in a war.  
**"NOT JUST THE HUMANS. THE STARS TOO, IN THEIR OWN WAY."**  
And she learns that the stars did the same to eachother.  
**"THEIR POINTLESS WARS... THERE'S NOTHING LEFT."**  
The wars were pointless for both humans & stars.  
**"WE ONLY HAVE EACHOTHER. IT'S ALL THEIR FAULT."**  
Katherina agrees with his statements. They continue to discuss other topics.

. . .

After a while, they reach the topic of their future. **MARS** would set the tone:  
**"IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW. THIS COLD PLACE IS OUR HOME. WE WILL MAKE IT OUR HOME."**  
The girl follows the idea of his plans, and they agree that it's in their best interest to build a home atop the remains of Venus. **MARS** reminds her:  
**"YOU DON'T HAVE TO BURDEN YOURSELF WITH THIS. REMEMBER, YOU CAN BACK OUT ANYTIME."**  
She quickly answers.  
**"I UNDERSTAND."**  
The air is still for a brief second. Then **MARS** asks:  
**"DO YOU LOVE ME?"**

## ACT 7 – Red Sex
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1985 … Location: Venus

The sex was a little awkward.
She always felt so small.

Katherina loved to sing and dance. She'd take a step back every now and then, just to keep me off her track – keeping me lulled, entranced…

That skinny, skinny frame…
That tired, tired act…
She's uninteresting wearing all that black.

I just can't help myself – I take peeks into her dreams, every now and then. She thinks of the times before the flash – of Venus and the **SUN**, that they were so close she'd kiss him. She wonders "if they were so close, why'd the **SUN** leave?".

And then she spirals from there…

"Was it the way everyone screamed and bickered here?"
"The smog covering our sky?"
"The factories and the residential districts?"
"Or was it all the tears Venus shed?"
"The labyrinthine tunnels in her skin?"
"Would the **SUN** still make love to her disfigured mantle?"
"Did Venus feel lonely, too?"
"Why is **MARS** always standing up there? Why can't he come closer, why can't he embrace me, why must he be so distant? If we kissed, would I start burning too? I'm his little **SUN**, I'm his little **SUN**…"

I normally shut her up by the time she gets to that part.

## ACT 8 – Waiting For Black Metal Records To Come In The Mail
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1986 … Location: Venus

Katherina's life felt like a joke at her expense.  

Everytime she woke up, **MARS** was always facing some other direction. 
Enough time had passed that she'd see discernible features on him, craters like beauty marks, hills and mountains like deep scars. And yet, she could never reach him. She could never touch him, so close and yet so far away.

Each morning, Katherina would scramble for the tin box of mixed teabags, possibly the one thing she could still enjoy about the life she lived. The canned food ran out long ago. She'd subsist almost solely on rice with honey or ground sugar cubes, and if given a special occasion, a little syrup never hurt. Despite this, the sweet sensations brought next to no pleasure.

All the standard phosphorus lights malfunctioned. Gasoline was low, to the point where she'd stumble around in darkness just to conserve it. Keeping herself busy with arts and crafts was growing more and more difficult. **MARS** did not really take a liking to her drawings, and her karaoke was increasingly uninspired. The buzz & hum of the failing monospeaker felt disturbing. He still enjoyed her dancing. Actually, he loved her dancing. No, he was obsessed. The more sensual, the better. 

She felt like she was being slowly betrayed, and as her mind sharply declined, the pressure, demands from **MARS** would shoot higher and higher.

Their more philosophical & practical discussions stopped altogether. It's just about demands and sex now. "Sex ruins everything that could've been beautiful", she thinks.

**MARS** had to be hiding something. Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and this could not be kept up any longer.

## ACT 9 – Attempt #333
## Period: 29 Years Ago … Year: 1959 … Location: Earth

Sarah "Sam" Ackermann, a hobby researcher from the former Earth province of Germany, is neck deep in debt to the wrong people. The space colonization efforts were just starting in this period. Hoping she could create an ultra-durable material capable of assisting in colonization of the toughest environments, she gets to work in search of her future patent. These are a few of her test logs.

## ACT 10 – Black Metal Records
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: Venus

Tonight was silent.

The only method **MARS** would communicate with Katherina was by reading her mind. And inserting his words there. The nights that he'd take over her body were the worst. But tonight was quiet & still – not like Katherina felt the concept of day & night, whatnot with the **SUN** gone and all.

She did not think of what she was about to do. Her own thoughts would betray her. Katherina can't afford that.

As she feigned the usual bed routine - brisk dip in the lake, drying off her body and touching up her hair, rubbing some of the local vegetation on her teeth…

She slipped up. She had the thought.

**MARS**, in a fraction of a second, knew. The radio-waves travel fast.

Katherina's mind was flooded with the worst **MARS** could muster – Sinner, wrong doer, evil doer, worker of iniquity, a bad example, scoundrel, villain, knave, viper, wretch, the devil incarnate, monster, demon, fallen angel, lost sheep, black sheep, a loafer and a sneak. A good for nothing fucking bitch and a whore.

And she felt her legs giving way, she felt weak, she felt sick to her stomach, she felt like she was losing control over her body. No. Her body was being taken from her.

No. My body is being taken away from me again. You took my mind already.

Leave me alone.

**"LEAVE ME ALONE."**

**"MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE. MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE."**

**"I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS."** 

**"I WANT TO BREAK."**

In a swift motion, **KATHERINA** swiped her hand across the night sky, thinking she can take him down with her.

Thoughts run down, drip down, become reality. The curse of the **RED KING**.

**MARS** was plucked. She held him in her hands.

Then, a flash. Her eyes went blind.

The truth was there. 

Mars was hiding the **SUN**.

Mars hid the **SUN** from **KATHERINA**.

Mars hid the **SUN** from Venus.

Mars hid the **SUN** from millions.

Mars was responsible.

Mars would be sorry.

Mars was the night, the nightmare.

## ACT 11 – Curse of the RED KING
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: VENUS

_**KATHERINA**, with Mars in her cupped palms, levitates above the yellow atmosphere of Venus. She's fuming with anger, boiling, stewing… frothing. And yet her mouth won't open._

**KATHERINA.** Don't do this. Put me back, please. I thought you loved me.

*Her voice crackles across the night-sky louder than any thunder of Venus.*

**"I THOUGHT I LOVED YOU. BUT YOU WERE JUST ALL I HAD. YOU MADE SURE YOU WERE ALL I HAD."**

That's not true, **KATHERINA**. You were all I had too – celestial bodies were never allowed to interact with humans. I broke all the rules just to get to know you. I wanted to see what it was like.

**"SEE WHAT? TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO USE SOMEONE LIKE A FLESH SOCK?"**

It wasn't my intention, dear… you showed me what pleasure felt like. I grew addicted, I grew more and more discontent with the lack of feeling I was cursed with – I wanted more and more. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry **KATHERINA**.

_**KATHERINA** can't think of anything._

**KATHERINA**, dear. We can fix this. You just have to trust me. Remember when we first met? Let's start again… This time, you say my name first.

**"NO. I REFUSE. I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE CONTROL AGAIN."**

Don't be stubborn, love. You've grown so much… there's no point in all this control non-sense anymore. And… I've always watched you from afar. I know you – I always kept an eye out for you, because you were special. Hey, hey, now…

_**KATHERINA** goes speechless. Her facial expression is one of contempt, confusion, and regret._

Aren't you my little **SUN**?

*She screams. And the scream echoes. And the scream fades. And underneath that layer of noise, she's sobbing. Sobbing like a little crybaby. Sobbing like she just lost her parents. Her palms relax.*

Hey, hey, calm. Don't you want to know your parents? Your childhood?

_**KATHERINA** wants to know. She really, really does want to know. It's her chance, her only one.*_

**"I… I DO. I DO WANT TO KNOW"**

You were born of two Venusian mothers. They loved and cherished you – they would've done everything to keep you. This is not the way things go in this world, unfortunately. Men in armor from some far-away planet came and took little **KATHERINA** away. I watched you grow up in the bunkers of these men – they'd malnourish you, hurt you and call you awful names – they thought you were an ill omen, an icon of the coming Apocalypse. When you were of age, they injected you with some white substance, and you forgot everything. They dropped you off somewhere far away, as they packed their bags up and shot everyone left in the head. This is your story, **KATHERINA**. This is what you wanted to hear, right?

*Her stomach knots. **KATHERINA** grips Mars harder.*

**"THAT CAN'T BE… IT'S LIES… YOU'RE LYING AGAIN…"**

Stop… Stop! You're hurting me!

*She reflexively relaxes her fingers, and releases her clenched palms.*

This is what I wanted to protect you from. The bitter truth, and the pain that comes with it. I love you, **KATHERINA**, I really do. Can we start again? Do you trust me?

*She's decided.*

**"I TRUST YOU."**

Say my name.

**"MARS… I-"**

*Katherina falls - she falls further than she's ever fallen before. Not in love… but in altitude. She's dropping to the ground.*

_**MARS** catches her._

**"I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.**

*Katherina turns pale. Her eyes, empty. Her Venusian soul-essence is returning to the cursed ground she was made of.*

**"MY LITTLE SUN. I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. I JUST CAN'T… I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN…"**

_**MARS** strokes her shriveling, now-white hair._

**"VENUS IS DEAD."**

**"I NAME YOU VENUS."**

**"LONG LIVE VENUS."**

*And **VENUS** would be once more.*

## ACT 12 – Stories
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1988 … Location: URANUS

A man in his forties stands in front of his reckoner box. He tries to select the Broadcast Channel but is quickly interrupted by a damn-near one minute advertisement.

> *When people think of **VENUS**, they think of acid, black lungs, and sex cultists…*
> *Think again.*
> 
> *The Blood Ocean Phenomenon has entirely revitalized the shamed little sister of our System.*
> 
> *But how did we get here? Well, it all started with pioneer Sarah "Sam" Ackermann, who invented Azbestite.*
> *Azbestite, yes, of all things, started out in her cramped garage on the lost province of Germany, Earth. Come this breakthrough, colonization efforts were revolutionized.*
> 
> _**VENUS** was conquered. The mines labored. The factories churned._
> *Most importantly, the phosphorus supply was steady.*
> *Everything was seemingly fine.*
> 
> *Then we lost all contact.*
> 
> *Not anymore.*
> *Come see the blood.*
> *Come see the red.*
> *Wash away your sins.*

He closes the hourly scheduled advertisement and swiftly rushes to the so-familliar Broadcast Channel rectangle.

> *"…THE PERPRETATOR WAS CONVICTED ON SUSPICION OF VENUSIAN IDEALS AND ARRESTED BEFORE INCIDENT…"*

> . . .
> 
> *"MORE RADICAL SEX SUPREMACY PROTE-"*

Another man, in his thirties, drags the Asset Protection captain by the collar and gives him a stern lecture.

"Turn that shit off, Jack. You know watching the Broadcast Channel isn't good for your health. She left you for a reason. Get a grip", he remarks.

"Heard the news? **VENUS** is back on the menu, baby!"

"Tomorrow we're on guard duty for some civillian marks and their hovercycle – said they wanted to see the blood oceans for themselves", the lieutenant says while staring at his clipboard.

He scoffs – "7-P's calling it a tourist resort. I call it total lunacy."

## ACT 13 – Water Womb World
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1989 … Location: VENUS

> An old woman, wrinkled face, hurriedly enters a closed office with a sizeable box of tapes. She tosses most of the lot away and produces one labeled "Vitruvian Motel – VAP 33-102", inserting it into her personal reckoner.
> 
> The reckoner's monitor slowly boots up. She quickly opens the command panel and types the commandline scrawled under the tape.

***BDYRECK-FOOTAGE – VAP 33-102 – 11-06-1988***
***AUDIO… ACTIVE***

MIKE: This thing on? 1-2-3. 1-2-3.
**TANGO:** Uh-huh.  

***VIDEO… ACTIVE***

*The monitor hums and buzzes as it reveals an image of two other men. Guns, rudimentary, almost outdated. Body armor, missing. One's young and scrawny, no helmet on. The other's got a beret and quite the stern look. Stylish balaclava beneath it.*

***MOTION… ACTIVE***

MIKE: Alright. This is **VENUS** Asset Protection... what was it? 
*ZETA:* 33-102.
MIKE: Yeah okay. 33-102. We're here to investigate two critical missing assets. In and out, quick and easy. Our marks were last spotted next to the... "Vitruvian Motel". Two floors. Bit shady that place, in my opinion. Yo Tango, look at this shit! It's fuckin' two stars?  
**TANGO:** Real ace, this one…
*ZETA:* Moving in.

*The squad approaches the front door. The locale looks shady, decrepit, and suspiciously rusty, even for 7-P tourism standards.* 

**TANGO:** Yeah, no. Flashlight on. And keep it on.
*ZETA:* VAP 33-102. Entry point has been breached, moving further in. Natural light waning.

*They enter the reception room - the place is trashed.*

*ZETA:* We're in the reception.
MIKE: I can hear the ocean.
**TANGO:** Don't think about it. They say it's cursed with slave juju shit.
*ZETA:* Shut the fuck up. Both of you.

*Mike proceeds to check the rooms thoroughly alongside his squadmates. Thought nothing was weird on video. 'Till I took a closer look. There were no mirrors in the whole place.*

*ZETA:* Clear.
MIKE: Clear on my side.  
**TANGO:** All clear.

*The three of them continue deeper into the building, ascending the stairs. The sound of the ocean fades out as they ascend to the second floor.*

**TANGO:** The air is stiff.
MIKE: You think someone's been here?
**TANGO:** Look down. There's track marks on the ground. Frenzied steps.

***MOTION DETECTED… FRONT TOWARDS TOP***

*Shadows dance around the room. They don't seem to notice.*

*ZETA:* Clear this place out and check the next floor.

*The lack of mirrors continues to pique my interest. Sound from outside is completely muffled. As I look even closer, there are no windows or balconies. I rewind back. This building had windows. They don't notice, once again. I fastforward to where I left off.*

MIKE: How many fuckin'... floors... does this place have?  
**TANGO:** The report said 6. Chin up, soldier.

*Immediately after opening the entrance to the hallway of Floor 6, the sound of the blood ocean blares against the background. I adjust the volume. I don't know if they hear it.*

**TANGO:** Our mark is here, stay alert.

*They approach the door to Room... I can't fucking tell. I look at it and my head aches.*

MIKE: O-OPEN THE DOOR, IT'S THE FUCKING COPS.  
*ZETA:* Kick it down.

*The door swings open.* 

***MOTION DETECTED… FRONT TOWARDS LEFT TOWARDS RIGHT TOWARDS BOTTOM TOWARDS TOP TOWARDS BEHIND…*** 

***MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION***

*A fair-skinned woman, no older than 20 at best, lies naked strapped on the bedframe. She seems untouched. She won't stop screaming. She remembers. Despite their efforts, she does not calm down.*

**TANGO:** I'm gonna untie you, ma'am. You are safe. We are here to help you.
*ZETA:* Ma'am, do not run. No sudden movements.

*I hear the serene waves and the clear breeze. I don't want to think about what the room looked like. She was untouched, that's what matters. Mike is not saying a word. They end up dragging her by the handcuffs. She won't stop screaming. They descend 8 times.*

**ZETA:** We're near the end. I see the trapdoor, we're nearly out. You'll be alright.

*They emerge out of the cellar. The rust creaks. They're back at the entrance of the standard issue cement bunker.*

***BDYCAM-FOOTAGE -- VAP 33-102 -- 11-06-1987 - LOGGED OUT OF SESSION***

> *The woman jerks out of her seat and runs toward the nearest exit. There's still time left. Time left to warn them…*

## ACT 14 – The Red Chariot

## Period: ?????? … Year: ?????? … Location: ??????

_**NEPTUNE**, the **APEX OF JUDGEMENT** would seal my fate – execution._
*I'm guilty for what I've done to Katherina.*
*I alone was supposed to pay the toll.*

*However.*
*I was not alone in all I did.*
*There is something out there. Something way past the **SUN**, way past the reaches of this **GALAXY**.*
*The **==DEMIURGE==**, the **==FOOL==**.*

_**SATURN**, the **DARK HIEROPHANT**, was wise beyond my years. She'd understand. I pleaded to her during the trial. In exchange for postponing my inevitable execution, I'd give them all the death of this **==DEMIURGE==**. I'd make it pay, I'd find the root of the cosmic evil and I'd erase it forever…_

*The plans went into motion.*

*The **SUN** would discipline me with his 35,000,000 whips for an untold time so I would never lie again.*

_**URANUS**, the **TOWER OF CALAMITY**, dilligently collected parts of her mantle and fused them with souls her soldiers collected over the years, coalescing them into my otherwordly carbon shell – it would offer both physical and spiritual protection. Then, **MERCURY**, with his **UNMATCHED STRENGTH**, would spend years dividing his magmatic core to forge a bullethead capable of splitting stars in two – equipped with a kill-switch in the likelihood I defect. Encased in my custom shell of death, I never felt more ready._

*Finally, **JUPITER**, the **WORLD SEEKER**, armed me with the knowledge to transcend the barrier of light-speed – the simple celestial slingshot. I closely enter the orbit of the **SUN**, spin around three times. I gain speed with each passing rotation. Then another nine times. Twenty-seven. Eighty-one. And by the time I reach two-hundred fourty-three…*

*I break out of my gravitational prison.*

*I barrel through the inky expanse of space at 300,000,000 meters a second.*

*As my hatred simmers and burns in me, I become faster, lighter. My armor will eventually break, but my resolve not.*

*The **==FOOL==** will pay for everything – every wrongdoing ever done, be it celestial or terrestrial. No matter how many milennia it'll take.*

_My crusade is righteous, my cause just. I burn with the lost souls of billions. I am the last hope of a dying WORLD. The **==RED CHARIOT==**._

## ACT 15 – Flies Have Their House
## Period: Present Day … Year: 1989 … Location: NEPTUNE

Chief Executive Officer Edelweiss sits – hands in lap – in front of her reckorder device. This was the same meeting table she delivered hundreds of rousing speeches in. Only now, she's alone.

"Good morning, citizens. This is Avery-Mary Edelweiss."

*The digital backdrop behind her frame depicts seven planets in a ring around her – one of them hangs above the rest.*

*There is a shaking uncertainty in her voice.*

"Our yearly investment plan has s-shifted drastically… We're diverting all of our… r-resources across the **MERCURY** neo-industries… the **JUPITER** research station and all of its remaining moons… the **URANUS** defense barracks… **NEPTUNE**'s metropolis and management quarters… and lastly the **SUN** discipline center into… into…"

*The two women – a brunette & a red-hair – holding her at gunpoint push their barrels into her face slightly.*

"Into the dissolution of the Seven Planet Federation."

*The guards nod approvingly. Then, a piece of paper is swiped across the table.*

"As I sign this piece of paper… I hereby declare… the wholesale acquisition of the S-seven Planet Federation… to the new Venusian administration…"

*They stare at her handwriting attentively for any slip-ups, any legal loopholes she could toss in there. None would come.*

"I… I shall… No, I can't do this."

*The two women and their snake eyes throw a death glare.*

"I can't do this. Please let me go, I have a husb—

*Blood splatters the lens of the reckoner. The sound was deafening. Her still body kneels uselessly next to the table. The red liquid pools under the hole in her skull. It was the redhead who took the shot.*

"Remember."

*The brunette announces, wiping the lens of the reckoner whilst tossing her standard issue submachine gun on the table, as the redhead takes off her Venusian jacket and stows her rifle against the wall.*

"Remember the dignity of your womanhood. Do not appeal, do not beg, do not grovel. Take courage, join hands, stand besides us, fight with us."

*The speaker adjusts her hair. In the background, the redhead attaches a tape to the reckoner.*

"This song will broadcast until every last reactionary is found and shot."
