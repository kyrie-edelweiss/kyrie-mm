the calamitous tale
of silver winged angels
gripped, contorted, mutilated
desire demands all
i'm appalled

my sea of sin
my sulphur skin
the serene breeze
i'm on my knees
once again
never to maim

"don't toy with my heart
don't think i'll depart
don't knock down my shrines
please just look at my signs"
She took no heed.
Bleed.

sin burned innocence at the stake
and innocence's ashes spread to overtake
sin, wrought with guilt
went ahead and built
angels with bronze wings
so she could right things
