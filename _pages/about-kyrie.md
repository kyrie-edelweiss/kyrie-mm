i'm a transsexual woman from Bucharest, Romania. i'm interested in various types of coding, writing memorable stories, videogames and leaving a mark on the world.

# personality:
- i'm bold, hotheaded, sanguine, experimental, talkative, confident, curious, passionate, mysterious, disciplined, assertive, warm, loyal, persistent, fiery and motivated by failure.
- i'm also, at the same time, a total wallflower, agoraphobic, experimental, disorganized, impulsive, obviously mentally ill, prone to burnout, a bad example, the first to desert and a quitter.
- expressing myself, especially my emotions, is difficult and i cannot empathize with real people. this does not mean i'm emotionless and cold, though - i can still sympathize.
- i create for the sake of it.

# skills:
- english is my primary language despite being a native romanian speaker.
- i've learned to code in C# & HTML out of the need to create and be uninhibited. this site exists precisely because i did not want to bow to any payment services or book publishers.
- i am very open to my own detriment, and i trust too easily. take this however you want.
- i absorb and store practical information easily, but struggle with social information.
- i'm extremely imaginative yet i can still take action and get things done.
- i can see the big picture. i have the potential to be a capable leader, but those around me squander it.
- as a trans woman, i grew up to be adaptable, flexible, and unsatisfied with the bare minimum. i always give it my all and i'm not afraid to try everything - i am not dissuaded by failure.

# education:
- i could never integrate into the school system - i simply got my bachelor's diploma and got out of that environment.
- i prefer a practical, experimental approach to learning. i get curious about something and i research it on my own - this is how i got into programming, writing and testing.
- i view the world as largely interconnected in all aspects, and cyclical.
- i would like to learn german.

# occupations:
- i work as a videogame tester and write stories in my free time.
- for business opportunities reach out to me on Instagram.

# fun facts:
- i like red.
- my name stands for "Lord, have mercy".
- i had a cult at some point.
